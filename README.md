## :dart: About

As A USER,
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once,
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

This project will render a random users generated page from the Random User API and will render a table of employees with corresponding information and a picture.
